        Primary Clustering is when multiple different hashindexes share large segments of probing segments. To remedy this we can leverage Random Probing.
        Contrary to its name random probing leverages a Pseudo Random Sequence of array positions to tell us which slot to check next. For instance if the first slow in the random sequence array is two we would add two to the calculated hash index, if there is a collision there we would add the next value in the random Sequence to the initially calculated hash index

        Implementation overview:
            First make a pass to identify all runs. a run is a run of values that contain increasing or strictly decreasing values. If there is no run of size min_run available, we create it using insertion sort.
